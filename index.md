## About Me

I am currently a postdoc in the [Churchill lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-churchill-lab) at the [Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org/). My work involves the development and application of statistical methods to quantitative genetic questions. Key topics have included: 

1. Hierarchical modeling of mass-spectrometry proteomics
2. Genetic association and QTL mapping
3. Causal inference (mediation analysis)
4. Experimental design and applications in genetically diverse mouse populations, such as the [Collaborative Cross (CC)](https://compgen.unc.edu/wp/?page_id=99) and [Diversity Outbred (DO) stock](https://www.jax.org/strain/009376)

Previously, I completed my PhD in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://bcb.unc.edu/) at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), where I was a member of the [Valdar lab](https://valdarlab.unc.edu) in the [Department of Genetics](https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics).
