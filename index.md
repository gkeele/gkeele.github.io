## About Me

I am currently finishing up my PhD in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](https://bcb.unc.edu/) at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), where I am a member of the [Valdar lab](https://valdarlab.unc.edu) in the [Department of Genetics](https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics). In June 2018, I will be joining the [Churchill lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-churchill-lab) at the [Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org/) as a postdoctoral researcher. 

My work focuses on the development of statistical tools for analyses of multiparental populations, such as the [Collaborative Cross (CC)](https://compgen.unc.edu/wp/?page_id=99) and [Diversity Outbred (DO) stock](https://www.jax.org/strain/009376) in laboratory mice, with particular emphasis on experimental design, genetic association, and QTL mapping.
